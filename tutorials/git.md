# Git Tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll create your own repository on GitHub, 
make the repository available on your computer, edit and create some files,
and commit and push the edited files to GitHub.

## Creating a project repository

We'll create a tutorial from a template that already has a basic structure
and a basic version of the experiment that you will run as part of this course.

1. Go to [https://github.com/sebschu/my-project](https://github.com/sebschu/my-project).

2. Click the green "Use this template button" to create a new repository from this template.

3. Give the template a name (e.g., `my-project`) and click "Create repository from template."

This should redirect you to your newly created repository.

## Cloning the repository
