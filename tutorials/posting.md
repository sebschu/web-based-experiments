# Posting an Experiment

## Publishing the experiment

In order to run your experiment, it has to be available at a public HTTPS URL. One advantage of storing the experiment code on GitHub is that you can set up a respository to make your experiment publicly available.

1. Go to your repository (`https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USER>/<NAME-OF-REPOSITORY>`)
2. Click on _Settings_ in the upper-right corner
3. Scroll down to _GitHub Pages_
4. Select your main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`)
5. Click _Save_

After building your website (this may take up to a minute), your experiment should then be available at

`https://<YOUR-GITHUB-USER>.github.io/<NAME-OF-REPOSITORY>/experiments/01_implicature_strength/experiment.html`

For example, my experiment is available at:

[https://sebschu.github.io/my-project/experiments/01_implicature_strength/experiment.html](https://sebschu.github.io/my-project/experiments/01_implicature_strength/experiment.html)
