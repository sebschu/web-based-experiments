## Determining sample size

*ADD CONTENT*

Two R packages for running power analyses are:

- `pwr`, which is sufficient for most inferential statistics (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA). 
- `simr`, which is specifically for mixed effects models. It calculates power by simulating data and results from a model you specify.
